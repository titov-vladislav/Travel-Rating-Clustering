# Travel Rating Clustering

This dataset describes how users rate their estimates. And if you look at some of them, we can see that theyâ€™re quite clearly divided into groups. Our job is to learn how to separate them. This is important because it will allow us to work more efficiently with our users. For example, based on clusters, we can offer people services more specifically and personalized.

## Code and Resources Used
Python Version: 3.7

Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn

This data set has been sourced from the Machine Learning Repository of University of California, Irvine (UC Irvine) : Travel Review Ratings Data Set

The UCI page mentions the following publication as the original source of the data set: Renjith, Shini, A. Sreekumar, and M. Jathavedan. 2018. Evaluation of Partitioning Clustering Algorithms for Processing Social Media Data in Tourism Domain. In 2018 IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems (RAICS), 12731. IEEE

## Goals and objectives
My goal to divide users in different clusters, which would help us to recommend them different types of advertisment
To do this I should do next things:

  - To make exploratory data analysis

  - To prepare our data for clustering

  - To build and upgrade our Machine Learning Clustering Model
